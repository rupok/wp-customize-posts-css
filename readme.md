## Description ##

Since WordPress 4.7 core has provided an Additional CSS section in the Customizer for users to add and preview custom CSS for their site (see [#35395](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395)).

This plugin brings the same functionality to be able to provide custom CSS for individual posts and pages on your site. The custom CSS will be output in `style` elements whenever `the_post` is done. The CSS is stored in a `custom_css` postmeta and Custom CSS is presented for every post that has the `custom_css` post type support, which is given to all public posts by default.

This plugin has a few dependencies:

* It requires the [Customize Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-posts/) plugin for adding the ability to manage and preview postmeta in the Customizer. The Custom CSS control is added to the post/page Customizer sections which this plugin adds.
* It relies on CodeMirror being in core as of 4.9-alpha. See [#12423](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423).
* It uses the `WP_Customize_Code_Editor_Control` proposed for WordPress 4.9. See [#41897](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41897).

See also [#38707](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38707) which proposes extending the Custom CSS editor in core with being able to edit per page CSS.

### The custom CSS appears with the post on an index page, and here the `.hentry` selector is key.

### The custom CSS also appears with the post on its singular template, and here a `body` selector with an appropriate post-specific class name is useful for changing the look of the entire page.
